Welcome to my Fully Automated E-commerce Web App! This project began as a simple photography portfolio and evolved into a robust e-commerce store, seamlessly integrating technologies to provide users with a streamlined and immersive shopping experience.:

## Project Journey

This project started with a passion for photography and a desire to showcase and sell prints of captivating images. As it progressed, it evolved into a full-scale web app, merging two passions into one ambitious endeavor. I decided to try and create my own Shopify like store that would be extremely cost effective. I think I have reached this goal. This web app costs around $2-$5 a month to upkeep(I won't count my time because it was a learning experience). Along the way, I encountered challenges, made enhancements, and continuously refined my platform to offer the best possible experience to my customers.
